# Welcome to "Intern Chatter" React JS Project!

Hello and welcome, interns! ðŸš€ You are about to embark on an exciting journey with our new React JS project, "Intern Chatter." This project is designed to enhance your skills and provide you with hands-on experience in building modern web applications using React.

## Getting Started

### Fork the Repository

The first step is to fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project under your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original codebase.

1. Navigate to the [Intern Chatter Repository](trebnet-interns/intern-chatter (github.com)(https://github.com/trebnet-interns/intern-chatter)).
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page.
3. Wait for the process to complete, and you'll have your own copy of the project.

### Make Your Assigned Contribution

Each intern has been assigned a specific task or feature to work on. Please refer to the project board or the task assignment document for details on your contribution.

- **Code Structure:** Familiarize yourself with the project's code structure. The main React components are located in the `src` directory.

- **Install Dependencies:** Run the development server using `npm install` to see the project in action locally. This will help you understand the existing functionality.

- **Development Server:** Run the development server using `npm run dev` to see the project in action locally. This will help you understand the existing functionality.

- **Task Implementation:** Make the necessary changes to implement your assigned task or feature. Ensure your code follows best practices and is well-documented.

### Open a Pull Request

Once you have completed your contribution and thoroughly tested your changes, it's time to open a pull request (PR) to merge your code into the main project.

1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "New Pull Request" button.
3. Ensure the base branch is the main project's branch, and the compare branch is your feature branch.
4. Provide a clear and concise title and description for your pull request.
5. Click "Create Pull Request."

### What's Next?

Congratulations on making your contribution! Now, the project maintainers will review your code, provide feedback, and merge it into the main project if everything looks good.

Feel free to ask for help or clarification at any stage of the process. This project is not just about coding; it's also about collaboration and learning from each other.
